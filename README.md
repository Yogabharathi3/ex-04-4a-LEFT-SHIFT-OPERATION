# EX-04-4a-LEFT-SHIFT-OPERATION
## AIM 
To write a C Program to perform the basic left shift operation for 44 integer 
number with 3 shifts. 
## ALGORITHM 
1. Start the program. 
2. Assign values of a and b as 44 and 3. 
3. Use left shift operator (<<) and shift the value of a three times. 
4. Display the result. 
5. Stop the program. 
## PROGRAM
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
 int a=44,b=3; 
 printf("After Left Shift Operation value of a is:%d",a<<b); 
}
```
